### Example files

#### scratch_export_csv.py
This Python Scratch custom command script creates a .csv file with a line for each shot containing information about the shot.  If there are selected
shots, then the CSV will only contain those shots.

#### scratch_playlist2copypaste.py
Similar to the export_csv example, this Scratch custom command script collects the filepaths of all (or just the selected) shots and puts it 
into the copy-paste buffer using PyperClip.
